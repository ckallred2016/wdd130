            <p>Hello! My name is Krystal Allred. I live in Utah, USA and am currently a stay-at-home mom and a student pursuing Software Development. I love to travel, so I was very excited to visit Tokyo, Japan this past December 2024 with my family. My husband will soon finish up his Phd in Computer Science and I am excited to see where the Lord takes us next.</p>

            <p>Living in northern Utah, we have the privilege of being minutes away from nature. The mountains surround us and hikes and natural wonders awe us as we drive around and take a day to explore. We are also blessed to have the Logan Temple in our midst. It stand so tall on hill that makes it visible from all over Cache Valley.</p>
